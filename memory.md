# About

SpaceEngine is a realistic virtual Universe you can explore on your computer. You can travel from star to star, from galaxy to galaxy, landing on any planet, moon, or asteroid with the ability to explore its alien landscape. You can alter the speed of time and observe any celestial phenomena you please. All transitions are completely seamless, and this virtual universe has a size of billions of light-years across and contains trillions upon trillions of planetary systems. The procedural generation is based on real scientific knowledge, so SpaceEngine depicts the universe the way it is thought to be by modern science. Real celestial objects are also present if you want to visit them, including the planets and moons of our Solar system, thousands of nearby stars with newly discovered exoplanets, and thousands of galaxies that are currently known. 

# FAQ

Q: How many real objects are there in SpaceEngine, and how many are generated by the program?
A: The entire Hipparcos catalog of stars, as well as all known extrasolar planets, over ten thousand galaxies, and all of the most prominent objects in our Solar system are included. This adds up to over 130 000 objects. As for procedural objects, there are more galaxies and star systems in SE than exist in reality in all of the observable universe.
 

Q: May I make a video with SpaceEngine or use screenshots or skyboxes made with SE for my own use?
A: Yes, you may use SpaceEngine products for non-commercial use as long as you cite SpaceEngine as the source for those assets. Please see the license page for full details.
 

Q: Why are there some gigantic dwarf stars, and small giant stars?
A: The Hipparcos-based star catalog that SpaceEngine uses contains some errors and missing data. If you find a real star which seems to have erroneous data, please post its name in this thread, this will make it much easier to fix the stars in the future.
 

Q: Why is Vega binary, but 40 Eridani is solitary? Is it a bug?
A: This is not a bug. SpaceEngine currently has an incomplete catalog of binary stars, so it makes some real binary/multiple stars are still represented as a solitary. But you make contribute to the development of the program by making a script for a binary or multiple star which are not represented in SE.
 

Q: Why do stars like Eta Carinae and Deneb have such low luminosities?
A: Most of the light from these stars is blocked by interstellar dust before it reaches Earth, so these stars do not look as bright as they really are. When these stars are put into SpaceEngine using their apparent magnitudes, it gives them low luminosities. Unfortunately, SE cannot simulate interstellar extinction, so it is impossible to have their luminosities be correct without making them look unrealistically bright in the sky.
 

Q: How can an Ice Giant be “Hot”? This makes no sense. Is it a bug?
A: “Ice Giant” is a scientific term for a planet that has a mass between 10 and 50-70 Earth masses and composed primarily of water, ammonia and methane. These substances in the planet’s interior are in the form of a high pressure high-temperature modification of ice, so the planet is called an “Ice Giant”. Surface temperature doesn’t matter.
 

Q: How can an Oceania be “Hot”? This makes no sense. Is it a bug?
A: “Oceania” is a scientific term for a planet up to 10 Earth masses and composed primarily of water. Surface temperature doesn’t matter. On a hot oceania, water in the upper atmosphere is in the form of hot vapor, but farther down it smoothly transitions into a liquid state under high pressure. Even deeper it turns into a solid state called ice VII.
 

Q: How can I add my own objects to SpaceEngine, or modify existing ones?
A: Go to the Manual > Making addons page of the website. It contains detailed manuals about modding in SpaceEngine. You can ask question and share your work with community in the Mods and addons forum.

Q: How do I find Earth?
A: Hit [F3], type “Earth”, and press [Go to]. Alternatively, press [Shift]-[H] several times (this will select Milky Way, the Sun, Earth), and hit [G] key.

A: Time is paused. Unpause it with the [Space] key.
 

Q: How do I remove text info from the screen?
A: Press [Ctrl]+[~]. Press it again to restore the text.
 

Q: Is there a way to use the program and change settings without using keyboard commands?
A: Yes, SpaceEngine has a toolbars on the lower left and lower right of the screen. To open a toolbar, mouse over the edge of the screen that the toolbar is located at. To lock the toolbar open, press the pin icon. Hold the mouse over a button to learn its function. Some buttons controls the program, other opens a various settings menus.
 

Q: Is there a way to prevent dim stars and planets from showing when bright objects are shown on screen?
A: Yes. Press [V] to toggle autoexposure. Alternately, you can toggle it in the graphics menu.
 

Q: Is there a framerate counter? How can I activate it?
A: Yes. Open the console by pressing [~], type “FPS”, and press [Enter]. This will enable the framerate counter.
 

Q: Is there any way to change the light settings, so that I can change the camera exposure or compare the relative illumination of different planets?
A: Yes. Press [Ctrl]+[F4] to open the graphics menu. “Real planet brightness” allows you to compare how much illumination different planets receive from their suns. “Real sun brightness” allows you to compare the relative brightness of different suns in a system. The magnitude and brightness menu [F7] allows you to change the camera’s exposure, the ambient light level, and magnitude limit settings.
 

Q: I have other questions about controls.
A: Look at the readme_eng.txt file located in the SpaceEngine\docs\ folder, it contains a list of all controls in the program. Alternately, you can open the in-game controls menu by the [F8] key to view and modify the controls.

# Making Addons

## Introduction

### SPACEENGINE FOLDERS

SpaceEngine has two major folders with data files, which can be found in its root (installation) directory: data and addons. They are equivalent in many respects. The first contains the standard SpaceEngine files, which you should not modify. The second mirrors the internal structure of the first one, and is used for user mods and addons. It has a higher priority when searching for files at startup. This means that if you have some file in the addons folder with the same path and name as a file in the data folder, SpaceEngine will load the file from addons. This is useful for creating mods which change some of the system files (such as shaders), without actually touching the system files.

Internally, the data folder has these standard subfolders inside: catalogs, locale, models, music, scripts, shaders, sounds, textures. 'Standard' means that SpaceEngine expects to find specific data files in these subfolders, for example, music files must be in data/music/, and star catalogs must be in data/catalogs/stars/ (some of these subfolders have their own next-level standard subfolders inside).

The addons folder may also contain these standard subfolders, which would work as mirrors of the subfolders in data. This means that SpaceEngine will load data files from both data and addons as if they were a single large folder (but with higher priority for addons in case of a file name conflict, as has been described above).

The addons folder also allows the use of additional internal subfolders, for better organization of addons. These additional subfolders may have any name (which obviously cannot match the name of the standard subfolder), typically representing the name of an addon or a franchise, for example addons/StarWars/. Internally, the additional subfolder may contain standard subfolders with data files: catalogs, models, textures and so on, or it may contain pak files (see below), or it may contain a next-level additional subfolder, for example addons/StarWars/EmpireShips/. SpaceEngine allows for an unlimited amount of nested subfolders (limited by OS, typically the path length must not exceed 256 characters).

### THE PAK FILES

pak files are zip archives provided for better organization and distribution of game content. For example, a large addon with thousands of files may be zipped into a single pak file and distributed in this form, which is more convenient for the user. Zip compression can also be used while creating the pak file, which is useful to save disk space and download traffic.

pak files are zip archives that include files and folders with the same structure as they have on the disk, starting from the data or addon root level (or addon/YourCustomFolder/). This means that the uppermost folder which can be zipped into a pak file is one of the standard subfolders: catalogs, models, textures and so on. SpaceEngine reads the content of all pak files at startup and uses them as a virtual file system with date priority. This leads to many consequences:

1) THE PAK FILE FORMAT
pak files are zip archives (i.e. .zip files with the extension renamed to .pak). You may associate the .pak file type with WinRar or 7zip or whatever program you use to work with archives, and open any .pak file and extract files from it. Creating a .pak file is easy too: just select needed files and folders and compress them as .zip, then rename it to .pak when finished.

2) VIRTUAL PATH
You may think of a pak file as a container for files/folders. The internal folder structure inside a pak file is a continuation of the SE folder structure. This means that SE looks for files and folders on the disk and inside all pak files as if there were no pak files and all their content is extracted at the place where these pak files are. We will call this a virtual path. The path of the disk in this article will be colored green, and inside the pak file will be colored orange. For example, these three virtual paths are equal (remember that the StarWars folder is optional):
addons/StarWars/StarWarsPlanets.pak/catalogs/planets/Coruscant.sc (packed into pak file)
addons/StarWars/catalogs/planets/Coruscant.sc (unpacked on the disk)
addons/catalogs/planets/Coruscant.sc (unpacked addon content moved to the addons root - still works)

3) PRIORITY BY MODIFICATION DATE
If there are two or more files with the same virtual path, SE will load the most recent one. It compares the modification date/time of the disk files, or those of the entire pak file. For example, consider that you have 3 files named SolarSys.sc in different places, but with the same virtual path:
data/catalogs/Catalogs0980.pak/planets/SolarSys.sc in the default pak file, pak date is 2016/08/06
data/catalogs/planets/SolarSys.sc unpacked on the disk, file date is 2016/09/01
data/catalogs/SolarSysUpdate001.pak/planets/SolarSys.sc in another pak, pak date is 2016/09/05
In this case, SpaceEngine will load the last one, because it has the most recent date. This is useful for making updates. Consider someone adding an addon with this file:
addons/SolarSystemMod.pak/catalogs/planets/SolarSys.sc pak date is 2016/08/15
In this case, SpaceEngine will load the file from this addon pak, despite its older date. This is because files in the addons folder have priority over files in the data folder. This is to prevent breaking addons after updating the default SE files. Inside the addons folder, the same file/pak modification date priority rules apply.

4) EXTRACTING FILES
You may extract any file from the pak archives by opening it as a zip archive. When extracting the file, you must create all the folders contained inside the pak, so the extracted file will have the same virtual path as the packed one (use the 'extract here' option in your archiver program). For example, if you want to extract the file SolarSys.sc from the Catalogs0980.pak, you must create the folder data/catalogs/planets/ and extract that file into it so that it has this path:
data/catalogs/planets/SolarSys.sc
After this, SpaceEngine will load the extracted file, because it will have the more recent date. Now you may modify it.

5) CREATING PAK FILES
For example, consider you are making a planetary system addon which has these files:
addons/StarWars/catalogs/stars/StarWarsSystems.sc
addons/StarWars/catalogs/planets/Coruscant.sc
addons/StarWars/catalogs/planets/Tatooine.sc
When you finish creating it, testing everything, and are ready to release, go to the StarWars folder, select the catalogs folder and pack it into a zip archive. Rename that archive to StarWarsPlanets-v001.pak. The file name doesn't really matter, but it should reflect the file's content, and having a version/revision number in it is also a good idea. After that, delete the catalogs/ folder and its content (or move it to some backup place) and leave only the newly created pak file. If you did the packing correctly, your addon should work in SE as before. Your data files will have this virtual path:
addons/StarWars/StarWarsPlanets.pak/catalogs/stars/StarWarsSystems.sc
addons/StarWars/StarWarsPlanets.pak/catalogs/planets/Coruscant.sc
addons/StarWars/StarWarsPlanets.pak/catalogs/planets/Tatooine.sc
So you are ready to share the file StarWarsPlanets-v001.pak with the community. Note that it will work if it is placed in any subfolder in the addons folder (except standard subfolders of course):
addons/StarWarsPlanets-v001.pak
addons/StarWars/StarWarsPlanets-v001.pak
addons/blabla/ololo/123/StarWarsPlanets-v001.pak
You are free to put any set of data files in a single pak file. For example, you may create a full Star Wars franchise pak, which includes all planetary systems, galaxy and galaxy model, and all ship models. Note that there are some restrictions.

6) RESTRICTIONS
1) The SpaceEngine root folder cannot be used as a place for pak files. The following will not work:
SpaceEngine/StarWars.pak/data/catalogs/planets/Coruscant.sc
2) The pak file cannot contain additional subfolders, only default ones are allowed. The following will not work:
SpaceEngine/addons/StarWars.pak/StarWars/StarWarsPlanets/catalogs/planets/Coruscant.sc
3) The pak file should be less than 4GB in size. If your addon is bigger than that, split it into several smaller pak files.
4) Music and sound files in ogg format cannot be zipped into pak files.

7) COMPRESSION RATE
Zip archives can be created with or without compression. SpaceEngine supports only the "Deflate" compression method. Some file types have a great compression rate (text files such as scripts and catalogs), some have a medium compression rate (binary files such as ship models .sm, .dds and uncompressed .tga images), some almost cannot be compressed (.jpg, .png, .tif images). It is a good idea to save a large set of image files (such as a planet textures addon) into an archive without compression, because it has great extracting/loading performance. Higher performance is always better than saving few megabytes of disk space. You could experiment to find better options for your addon. For example, you may save textures into a pak without compression, and scripts with models into another pak file with compression.

8) NEVER TOUCH THE DEFAULT PAK FILES
Just like in all other games, changing the default game resources is a bad idea. In the future, the game client will check the default files for changes and will kick you from the server if it finds that the default files have been changed. So remember these simple rules:
1) If you want to add something, create your own pak file (or simply store files in the folders, non-packed).
2) If you want to modify something, extract the file from the default pak and modify the extracted file.

### SPACEENGINE SCRIPTS

SpaceEngine has a special scripting language to describe astronomical objects, ships, models and configuration files, and for scenarios. Scripts are stored in files with the extensions *.sc, *.sss, *.cfg, *.se. All file formats are plain text documents, so you can edit them with notepad (or the better program Notepad++, which we recommend you download and install). Lets take a look at some of SpaceEngine's default catalog scripts. For example, look at the description of Saturn, located in the file data/catalogs/Catalogs0980.pak/planets/SolarSys.sc:

The script starts with the keyword Planet, followed by the string "Saturn". After that, there are many lines with some parameters enclosed in a curly braces. The construction Planet "Saturn" { ... } is called a tag and plays an important role in SE scripts. Tags divide the script into logical sections, and they can themselves include other tags (for example, Surface { ... }).

Tags can be named, like the Planet tag, or unnamed, like Surface. A named tag can have multiple, or alternate, names, separated by a slash '/'. For example: Star "ALF Cen/Toliman/Rigel Kentaurus/Gliese 559". All of these names identify the same object in SpaceEngine, and they can each be used to search for the object in-game, or to refer to it from another script (for example, you must specify a star name in the parameter ParentBody in the planet script - you can use one of the multiple names of the star there).

Greek letters, if used, must be entered in the object's name using abbreviations: ALF, BET, etc. This is the full list of abbreviations:

ALF	α	(alpha)
BET	β	(beta)
GAM	γ	(gamma)
DEL	δ	(delta)
EPS	ε	(epsilon)
ZET	ζ	(zeta)
ETA	η	(eta)
TET	θ	(theta)
IOT	ι	(iota)
KAP	κ	(kappa)
LAM	λ	(lambda)
MU	μ	(mu)
NU	ν	(nu)
KSI	ξ	(xi)
OMI	ο	(omicron)
PI	π	(pi)
RHO	ρ	(rho)
SIG	σ	(sigma)
TAU	τ	(tau)
UPS	υ	(upsilon)
PHI	φ	(phi)
CHI	χ	(chi)
PSI	ψ	(psi)
OME	ω	(omega)
A parameter is a line with the parameter name (keyword) on the left side and the parameter value on the right side. The name and value must be separated with spaces or tabs. Only one parameter per line is allowed. Parameters can be one of the following types:

string (text): Class "GasGiant"
number: Mass 95.162
vector: Color ( 1.000 1.000 0.850 ) or Color ( 1.000, 1.000, 0.850 )
number in 'deg min sec' or 'hrs min sec' format: Dec 18 32 16.23
boolean (binary): NoClouds true or NoClouds 1

Comments are allowed in SE scripts, which are in the C/C++ format:
// this is a single-line comment
/* this is an inline comment */
The first is the single-line comment. All text after the // symbols until the end of line is considered a comment and ignored by SE. The second is an inline or multi-line comment. All text between /* and */ is considered a comment and ignored by SE. New lines are allowed in this type of comment:
/* this is a
multi-line
comment */

### CATALOGS OF ASTRONOMICAL OBJECTS

SpaceEngine handles information about all catalog objects in script files (with the extension *.sc) or in CSV files (*.csv), located in the virtual directory */catalogs/. Both file formats are plain text documents, so you can edit them with notepad. The csv files can be edited using specialized software for editing csv (like Microsoft Excel, with some side effects). The directory */catalogs/ has subdirectories named galaxies/, clusters/, nebulae/, stars/ and planets/, for each type of object.

The majority of stars in the default SpaceEngine installation are stored in the csv file data/catalogs/Catalogs0980.pak/stars/HIPPARCOS.csv, and the main catalog of galaxies is in data/catalogs/Catalogs0980.pak/galaxies/NGC-IC.csv. They are the HIPPARCOS star catalog containing about 110,000 stars, and the NGC/IC galaxy catalog containing about 10,000 galaxies. Other objects, including some galaxies and stars with additional data, binary star systems, black holes, star clusters and nebulae, Solar System objects, and exoplanets and their host stars, are stored in multiple sc files in the same system pak. These default files should not be modified or changed in any way. If you want to update an object, remove it, or add a new one, create your own sc or csv file in the corresponding addon folder (addons/catalogs/stars/ for stars and so on). SpaceEngine has scripting options to modify and remove stars or other objects from the default catalogs, or to add new ones. After finishing work on your catalogs, you can zip the catalog files into the pak file and share it with the community.

The csv format is used to create large catalogs of objects with similar data. It is more compact and a lot faster than sc, but has limitations in the types of data which can be specified in it. It is just a table with values separated by a comma. The current version of SpaceEngine (0.9.8.0) supports csv files only for stars and galaxies. The sc format is designed to specify any possible data that SE can use to describe an object. It is script-like text with 'tags' used to describe an object (galaxy, star, planet etc) and its various parameters.

### ADDING, UPDATING, AND REMOVING CATALOG OBJECTS

If you describe a new object using SpaceEngine sc scripts, it will be added to the game. "New object" means that it didn't exist in SE before you made a script for it. More precisely, an object of the same type (for example, a star) and the same name didn't exist in SE. If the object of that type with the same name already exists in SE, it will be updated or merged with the data you have provided in your script. The order of merging (which data has priority) is defined by the modification date of the sc file or the pak file in which this sc file is packed. The newer file has higher priority, so some data from the script of this object in a previous file will be replaced with the new data provided. If the previous script doesn't have some specific data (for example, planet mass), but the new one has it, the newly provided data will be used.

Planetary objects (planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and stars in multiple-star systems) are identified in a more complicated way. SpaceEngine allows there to be many planetary objects with the same name, but with different parent bodies (specified in the parameter ParentBody). For example, the Solar system has two objects with the name "Pandora": a moon of Saturn and an asteroid. They have different parent bodies, Saturn and Sun, so they are different objects in SE.

While looking for identical objects, SpaceEngine scans all alternative names provided in the scripts. For example, you may update the old star Star "ALF Cen/Toliman/Rigel Kentaurus/Gliese 559" by describing a star in your script by Star "Toliman/Bungula". SpaceEngine will detect that this is the same object when it finds the name "Toliman". It will update the old star with the new data provided in your script, including the star name: it will add the new provided name "Bungula" to the list of alternative names, so it will become "ALF Cen/Toliman/Bungula/Rigel Kentaurus/Gliese 559". For a planetary object, as has been noted, you have to specify the parent object. SpaceEngine will merge them only if the object's name and parent object name are identical (any alternative name of the parent object can be used).

It's possible to cancel out some data in the old scripts, for example, NoClouds true will disable Clouds { } tags in the old scripts. But if the Clouds { } tags are provided for the planet which had NoClouds true in the old script, these Clouds { } tags will be used.

It's possible to change the type of an object by defining it with the other tag. For example, if older script has a planet "Kek" defined as Planet "Kek", and you create a new script and define it as Moon "Kek", it will change its type to moon. Changing the type is only possible within the set of types supported by the current catalog. This means that you cannot add a galaxy named "Saturn" to the planets catalog using the tag Galaxy "Saturn". It will be ignored by SE, because tag Galaxy is not allowed in the planets catalog. Here is the list of object types (tags) which are allowed in the corresponding catalogs:

Planet catalogs */catalogs/planets/*.sc: Star, Planet, Moon, DwarfPlanet, DwarfMoon, Asteroid, Comet, Barycenter
Star catalogs */catalogs/stars/*.sc: Star, StarBarycenter
Galaxy catalogs */catalogs/galaxies/*.sc: Galaxy, Quasar
Star cluster catalogs */catalogs/clusters/*.sc: Cluster
Nebula catalogs */catalogs/nebuale/*.sc: Nebula

It's possible to remove (more precisely, disable) some object from the old catalogs. Use the parameter Remove with the name of object you want to remove. For example, Remove "Toliman". It must be used outside any tag. Any of the object's alternate names can be used. Star catalogs also support the RemoveStar parameter with the same effect (for backward compatibility). In the planets catalog you must use a more complex construction: Remove "Saturn" { ParentBody "Sol" }. This is because SpaceEngine identifies a planetary object by its name and its parent's name.

Removing old objects is useful when upgrading the default SE catalogs. For example, the default star catalogs still have many binary stars described by two solitary stars. One can use Remove in the star catalog to delete them, and add a barycenter description to the same star catalog. Then make a planet catalog with two stars with proper orbits and that barycenter as their parent. See Creating a star for details.

Note: the Remove parameter affects all catalog files, regardless of their modification date. So if you used it once, it will no longer be possible to create an object of the same type with the same name. It is a bug in the current version (0.9.8.0).

### CHECKING FOR ERRORS IN CATALOGS

SpaceEngine can output some errors and warnings into the log file system/se.log while loading catalogs. This is useful for catching possible errors. There are two ways to enable logging: global and per catalog file. The global logging level is controlled by the parameters CatalogLogLevel (for sc catalogs) and CsvLogLevel (for csv catalogs) under the Log tag in the config/main-user.cfg file. Possible values are:

0 - do not log anything
1 - log errors and warnings, using the lesser log level between those in the main-user.cfg and in the sc file, if defined there
2 - log everything, using the lesser log level between those in the main-user.cfg and in the sc file, if defined there
3 - log errors and warnings, ignoring log level in all sc files
4 - log everything, ignoring log level in all sc files

The last two are used to override the log level settings in all sc files (not usable in the CsvLogLevel parameter). They are provided for global searching for catalog errors.

Each sc catalog file may have its own log level settings, specified by the parameter LogLevel, added somewhere in the global space (i.e. outside the tags Star, StarBarycenter etc). Possible values are:

0 - do not log anything
1 - log errors and warnings only
2 - log everything

It is recommended to specify LogLevel 2 in your sc files and CatalogLogLevel 2 in main-user.cfg while you are working on catalogs so you will have all information about star solver work in the log file (see Creating a star for details). If you need to see only possible errors, specify LogLevel 1. If some errors or warnings are still visible in the release version of your catalog (for example, no RA/Dec data are provided for a star, and star solver generates them procedurally), it's recommended to specify LogLevel 0, so other users will have their log files clean of errors related to your catalog.

## Creating a Star

This manual describes how to add a star to SpaceEngine. Before continuing, it is recommended you read this manual: Introduction.

The majority of stars in the default SpaceEngine installation are stored in the csv file data/catalogs/Catalogs0980.pak/stars/HIPPARCOS.csv. This is the HIPPARCOS star catalog with about 110,000 stars. Other stars, including binary systems, are stored in multiple sc files in the same system pak file. These default files should not be modified or changed in any way. If you want to update a star, remove it, or add a new one, create your own sc or csv file in the addons/catalogs/stars/ folder. SpaceEngine has scripting options to modify and remove stars or other objects from the default catalogs, or to add a new ones.

The csv format for catalogs is designed to create large catalogs of objects with similar data. It is more compact and loads faster than sc, but has limits to the types of data which can be specified in it. It is just a table with values separated by commas. The sc format is designed to specify all the possible data which SE can use to describe an object. It is a script-like text with 'tags' used to describe an object (star or star system in this tutorial) and its various parameters. First we'll describe the sc file format.

### THE STAR CATALOG

Let's consider that you want to create a new solitary star called "Mono", a black hole with accretion disk called "Hole", and a binary star system called "Bin", which contains two stars "Bin A" and "Bin B". Lets consider that stars "Bin A" and "Bin B" are described already in some catalog as solitary stars, and you want to delete them to create a proper binary star system with orbits for each component. Go to the addons/catalogs/stars/ directory (create it if it does not exist) and create a new text document there. Rename it to mystars.sc (the file name doesn't matter, but make sure it doesn't match some existing file, otherwise your file will override it). Open it in Notepad and type this code:

Code
// Creates a new object - a solitary star.
Star    "Mono"
{
RA       16 10 45  // right ascension
Dec     -25 12 11  // declination
Dist     100.0     // distance from the Sun
Class   "G5V"      // spectral class
Lum      0.86      // luminosity, or
//AbsMagn  5.31    // absolute magnitude, or
//AppMagn  10.31   // apparent magnitude
RadSol   0.95      // radius in Solar radii
MassSol  0.91      // mass in Solar masses
Teff     5200      // surface temperature in Kelvin
}
// Creates a new object - a solitary star (black hole) with extra
// parameters (accretion disk) in the planets catalog. Note
// that its name here is "Hole system", see why below.
StarBarycenter    "Hole system"
{

RA       09 31 14  // right ascension
Dec      64 16 38  // declination
Dist     250.0     // distance from the Sun
Class   "X"        // spectral class - black hole
Lum      150       // luminosity of the whole system (accretion disk)// That's enough, accretion disks will be described in the planets catalog (see below).
}

// Removes solitary stars from the older catalogs.
Remove "Bin A"
Remove "Bin B"

// Creates a new object - a barycenter of a binary star system,
// which components will be described in the planets catalog (see below).
StarBarycenter    "Bin"
{

RA       19 50 18  // right ascension
Dec      28 18 47  // declination
Dist     251.652   // distance from the Sun
// That's enough, the StarBarycenter tag doesn't need the other parameters (see below).

}

To add a new star or modify a star which has been already described in the catalogs, simply define a new object (Star or StarBarycenter) with the same name in the star script. SpaceEngine will update the old star with the new data (it's also possible to change its type - from Star to StarBarycenter and back).

To remove a star from the catalogs, use the Remove parameter with the name of that star. This is useful for upgrading binary stars in the catalog that are represented in SE as two seperate stars, into a complete binary star system with each star in a correct orbit. Note: the Remove parameter seems to affect all catalog files, regardless of their modification date. It is a bug in the current version (0.9.8.0).

Note that the star catalog does not describe the components of binary or multiple star systems. They must be described in the planets catalog and referring to the barycenter with the parameter ParentBody (see below). So, strictly speaking, the stars catalogs in SE are catalogs of star systems, not stars themselves (although they allow describing solitary stars without creating a planets catalogs for them). Visual parameters such as the overall luminosity of the system will be calculated by SpaceEngine automatically, based on the data of the system's components, described in the planets catalog. They may, however, be forced by defining parameters Luminosity, AppMagn etc. in the StarBarycenter tag.

### THE STAR SCRIPT DETAILS

The following parameters can be used inside the Star and StarBarycenter tags:

RA - right ascension in hours, in decimal format or formatted as HH MM SS.SSS
Dec - declination in degrees, in decimal format or formatted as DD MM SS.SSS
Dist - distance from the Sun in parsecs.

CenterOf - used to replace the procedural supermassive black hole system in the center of a galaxy or globular cluster. The parameter's value is the name of the galaxy or cluster, for example CenterOf "Milky Way". Only one supermassive black hole system can exist in a galaxy or cluster. If it is already defined in some catalog, it will be replaced/updated with this one. If this parameter is defined, the procedural supermassive black hole system in the corresponding object will be disabled, but this one will be rendered as a usual star system. So RA, Dec and Dist parameters are still required. A typical system must contain the black hole, optional accretion disk and many stars orbiting it. All these must be described in the planets catalog; the star catalog only deals with the coordinates of the system and its class (Class "X" or Class "BLACKHOLE").

NoPlanets - disable generation of procedural planets, if specified as NoPlanets true.

Lum, Luminosity, AppMagn, AbsMagn - allows one of these options, or combination of them (see "star solver" below for details):
Lum, Luminosity - star's luminosity in units of the Sun's luminosity, or
AppMagn - star's apparent (optical) magnitude, or
AbsMagn - star's absolute (optical) magnitude.
Advanced: AppMagnR, AppMagnr, AppMagnI, AppMagni, AppMagnJ, AppMagnH, AppMagnKs, AppMagnK, AppMagnW1, AppMagnW2, AppMagnW3 - star's apparent magnitude in corresponding spectroscopic bands. Use these only for brown dwarves, if their apparent magnitude in the optical band is unknown. SpaceEngine performs a simple computation of the optical apparent magnitude, assuming that star is a brown dwarf or late M dwarf. Don't use these parameters for other types of stars.

Class - a string with the spectral class of the star:
Normal star classes: O, B, A, F, G, K, M
Subdwarf classes: sdO, sdB, sdA, sdF, sdG, sdK, sdM (or O, B, A, F, G, K, M with luminosity class VI)
Brown dwarf classes: L, T, Y
White dwarf classes: DA, DB, DO, DQ, DZ, DC, DX, DAB, DAO, DAZ, DBZ or WD (general white dwarf class)
Wolf-Rayet classes: WN, WN/C, WC, WO
Zirconium and carbon classes: MS, S, SC, C-R, C-N, C-J, C-H, C-Hd, C, R, N
Special classes: Q, NEUTRON - neutron star, X, BLACKHOLE - black hole, Z, WORMHOLE - wormhole, P - planemo (rogue planet)
All classes listed above can have the subclass index - number 0 to 9 in decimal format (0 to 11 for Wolf-Rayet stars). SpaceEngine uses only up to one decimal, i.e. 3.25 will be rounded to 3.2.
All classes except white dwarves can have the luminosity class index: 0, Ia0, Ia+, Ia, Iab, Ib, II, III, IV, V, VI
Examples: Class "G2V", Class "M5.2III", Class "DB3.1", Class "sdB5" (equal to Class "B5VI").
A space is also allowed: Class "G2 V", Class "M5.2 III", Class "DB 3.1".
If the subclass or luminosity index could not be provided: Class "G2", Class "M III", Class "K". In this case SpaceEngine will try to calculate them based on available data (luminosity or visual magnitude and distance etc, see star solver), or assign default luminosity class "V" (the Main sequence star).

Mass - star mass in units of Earth masses, or
MassSol - star mass in units of Solar masses. Used only for solitary stars (tag Star). If defined in the StarBarycenter tag, it can be used in the star solver (see below).

Radius - star radius in kilometers, or
RadSol, RadiusSol - star radius in units of Solar radii. Used only for solitary stars (tag Star). If defined in the StarBarycenter tag, it can be used in the star solver (see below).

Teff, Temperature - temperature of the star's photosphere ("surface") in Kelvin. Used only for solitary stars (tag Star). If defined in the StarBarycenter tag, it can be used in the star solver (see below).

FeH - star metallicity. Not used for now, but will be used in future, so it's worthwhile to add it to the catalog if information is available.

You can use the star solver logging to detect errors in the stars catalog (for details see Star solver and Checking for errors in the Introduction to SE scripts).

### THE PLANETS CATALOG
Lets continue creating our example addon. The star "Mono" doesn't need anything extra to be put into the planets catalog, all needed information was provided in the stars catalog. It must have the black hole "Hole" and binary components of the system "Bin": "Bin A" and "Bin B". Go to the addons/catalogs/planets/ directory (create it if it does not exist) and create a new text document there. Rename it to myplans.sc (as has been noted in "the star catalog" section, the file name doesn't matter, but make sure it doesn't match some existing file, otherwise your file will override it). Open it in Notepad and type this code:

Code

Lets take a closer look at this script. It is called "planets catalog" because it is primarily designed for making planets and moons. But the "star body" itself, especially in binary systems, should also be described here. It's a common rule: any object that has an orbit must be described in the planets catalog. Components of a binary star do have orbits, so this is why they should be in the planets catalog. It also allows you to describe many more parameters than the stars catalog (rotation axis orientation and rotation period, star corona, accretion disk, surface textures, and orbit), so this is why even solitary stars such as the Sun also may be described in the planets catalog. To learn more about parameters used in the planets catalog, and about creating a planet, read the Creating a planet guide.

In the example code above, we first described the solitary star "Hole" with additional parameters which cannot be described in the stars catalog (rotational parameters and accretion disk). To specify them, it's necessary to describe the star in the stars catalog as a StarBarycenter, despite the fact that the star is solitary, and make a second description for it in the planets catalog with the tag Star. The ParentBody parameter in that Star tag must be set to the name of the StarBarycenter which you have described in the stars catalog. Important note: the Star tag in the planets catalog and the StarBarycenter tag in the stars catalog must have different names. I.e. if the star has the name "Hole", then the barycenter should be named "Hole system" or "Hole bar" or something like that. When creating an addon with some real star, which has multiple designations in the astronomical catalogs, it's a good practice to give one to the StarBarycenter, and the rest to the Star.

The planets catalog also allow you to specify the star's luminosity, absolute or apparent magnitude, spectral class, mass, radius and temperature - the same parameters as in the stars catalog. It's up to you where to specify these parameters: in the stars catalog or in the planets catalog, duplication in both is not necessary.

The Orbit tag must be skipped for solitary stars, SpaceEngine will generate a static position in the center of the system for that star. You may use Orbit { Type "Static" } or StaticPosXYZ (0 0 0) with the same effect, but this is not necessary.

The barycenter could also be used to create binary and multiple stars. In the planets catalog, we have described two stars "Bin A" and "Bin B" with their orbits around the main barycenter of the system "Bin" (see description of the Orbit tag in the Creating a planet guide for details). To create a hierarchical multiple star system, create a secondary barycenter (using the Barycenter tag in the planet catalog script), which orbits the main barycenter of the system, then add two stars which are orbiting this secondary barycenter. You may repeat this scheme many times to create more complex systems. SpaceEngine allows unlimited-tier hierarchy of objects, but in reality, star systems have no more than 3-4 levels of hierarchy.

The planets for each star or local barycenter could also be specified in the planets catalog. The parameter ParentBody for each planet/barycenter/star should be set to the name of the parent object which it is orbiting. If the star is solitary, and the planets catalog does not have any child objects (planets) for that star described, SpaceEngine will generate a procedural planetary system. You can disable this by specifying NoPlanets true in the stars script.

The parameters of a star/barycenter in the star catalog determines the appearance of the star while looking at it from interstellar space, i.e. when it is rendered as a point. For multi-star systems, SpaceEngine needs some "average" spectral class to render the system from far away. For procedural systems, SpaceEngine chooses the spectral class of the brightest star of the system (see "star solver" for details). This works very well in most cases, because luminosities of stars differ by many orders of magnitude. So when creating a multiple star system, you can specify the spectral class of the StarBarycenter (in the stars catalog) as the same as class of the brightest star in that system. Otherwise SpaceEngine will do that automatically. The luminosity of the StarBarycenter should be equal to the sum luminosity of all stars in the system (including luminosity of the accretion disks), or ignored to force star solver to automatically calculate it.

To summarise, please pay attention to the following, otherwise the code will not work or will work incorrectly:

1) In the stars catalog, describe a star with the StarBarycenter, if you want to specify the custom rotation parameters, accretion disk etc, or if you are creating a multiple star system. In that case you also must create a planets catalog and describe the star or multiple star components there. If you need only mass, radius and temperature for your star, or if you are okay with those values being generated/computed by SpaceEngine, describe it with the Star tag, and do not create a planets catalog.
2) The name of a star in the planets catalog must not be the same as the name of StarBarycenter. The name of StarBarycenter must be specified as the parent of the star in its ParentBody parameter.
3) If the star is solitary, either do not use the Orbit tag for it, or make its orbit static (Orbit { Type "Static" } or StaticPosXYZ (0 0 0)), so it coincides with the barycenter.
4) If the star is binary, describe the two stars with the name of the StarBarycenter in their ParentBody parameter, and make proper orbits around the barycenter for them.

You can use the star solver logging to detect errors in the planets catalog, as well as for the stars catalog (for details see Star solver and Checking for errors in the Introduction to SE scripts)

### THE STAR SOLVER

The star solver is a set of code that tries to compute or generate missing data for a star based on the provided data. It's often the situation in astronomy that some data is provided in catalogs, but some is missing. SpaceEngine requires these parameters to correctly render a star (star system):

- Full 3D coordinates of a star (RA, Dec, Dist). If the star catalog does not provide a distance, the star solver may try to compute it based on the apparent and absolute magnitude (or luminosity) of the star. If RA and Dec are not provided, star solver will generate random values for them, because there is no way to calculate them. A random value for distance is also generated if the star solver failed to compute it (see error logging below for more details).

- Star's spectral class. Without it, SpaceEngine will have no idea what this star is, and cannot render it. The star solver can try to determine the spectral class by looking at the radius, mass and temperature, if they are provided. For multi-star systems, the star solver takes the spectral class of the brightest component (either computed or taken from the planets catalog), and assigns it as the "class" of the whole system (if it was not specified in the StarBarycenter tag directly).

- Star's brightness. It can be computed from luminosity, absolute magnitude or apparent magnitude and distance. If none are provided, the spectral class can be used to roughly determine the luminosity. If even spectral class is not provided, the star solver may try to use radius and temperature to calculate luminosity using the Stefan–Boltzmann equation. For multi-star systems, the star solver sums up the luminosity of each component, and assigns it as the luminosity of the whole system (if it was not specified in the StarBarycenter tag directly).

- Star's physical properties: mass, radius and temperature. If not provided, the star solver will compute them based on spectral class (typically). Temperature can be derived from the spectral class directly, then radius is computed based on temperature and luminosity using the Stefan–Boltzmann equation. So if you run into an incorrect or unrealistic size of a star, try to find its real radius data and specify it in the catalog.

As has been noted, the star catalog cannot be used to define the rotational parameters of a star (i.e. rotation period, axial tilt and oblateness), as well as surface appearance (granulation cells size, etc), corona, accretion disk and orbit: the planets catalog is used for this. Some parameters can be generated procedurally if missing in the planets catalog. The planets can also be described in the planets catalog or be generated procedurally (if the planets catalog does not have any child objects for the star described, and the star script does not have NoPlanets true specified).

The star solver can print notifications about performed calculations, warnings and errors to the log file system/se.log on SpaceEngine startup. See Introduction to SE scripts for details about error checking in scripts.

### THE CSV FORMAT FOR THE STAR CATALOG

SpaceEngine supports csv ("Comma-Separated Values") format for massive stars and galaxies catalogs. It is a plain text format with one star described per line, with values separated with commas. The default SpaceEngine installation has one csv star catalog - data/catalogs/Catalogs0980.pak/stars/HIPPARCOS.csv, which has 112,523 stars, and has a size (unpacked) of only 7.5 MB. The csv format is more compact than sc, but has some limitations:
1) Only solitary stars can be described, analog of the StarBarycenter tag is impossible.
2) Only these parameters are allowed: Name, RA, Dec, Dist, AppMagn, SpecClass, MassSol, RadSol, Temperature.

The file format is simple: the first line is a header describing the names of the parameters (separated by commas), all the other lines are stars data - values of corresponding parameters (also separated by commas). Here is the example of the first 4 lines of the HIPPARCOS.csv file:

Code
Name,RA,Dec,Dist,AppMagn,SpecClass,MassSol,RadSol,Temperature
HIP 14066/HD 18665,3.02094205,36.1179219,487.804884,7.24999999,K2V,,,
HIP 14775/HD 278329,3.17876994,36.5130485,505.050497,10.1093756,K0V,,,
HIP 12888,2.76132567,32.8238759,476.190497,9.64843834,K0V,,,
Note that star name and its spectral class are not enclosed in quotes, and missing parameters (MassSol, RadSol and Temperature) are just blank, but commas separating them are still necessary.

The csv catalogs have a priority over sc catalogs, i.e. they are loaded first. But then star solver takes the file/pak modification date to perform star data merging or updating. The config-file parameter CsvLogLevel in the config/main-user.cfg file controls the star solver's logging level for all the csv files.

## CREATING A PLANET

This manual describes how to add a planet to SpaceEngine. Before continuing, it is recommended that you read these manuals first:
Introduction
Creating a star

### QUICK START: FIND A SIMILAR PLANET IN SPACEENGINE

The easiest way to add a planet is to find a procedural planet in SpaceEngine which you like, duplicate it in your planetary system script, then tweak its parameters a bit as you desire. You can quickly find a planet close to your needs by using the Star browser. Open it by pressing [Shift]+[F3], enter the search radius 100 and press the [Filter settings] button, then choose the desired filter parameters. In this example, we are looking for a temperate Earth-sized terra near a G class star:



Press the [Ok] button and wait until SpaceEngine finishes the search. Then you may click on each row, open the Solar system browser ([F2] key) and look for the planets SpaceEngine has found. Tip: to know exactly which planets satisfied the filter options, hover the mouse cursor over the table cell in the 'Filter' column (last column). A small box will appear with a list of the planets in that system which met the filter options.

So let's use RS 8474-918-7-65905-410 A4 as our example planet. Note: in your SpaceEngine version this planet may not exist or may look different due to installed mods/addons or a different version number.



It looks good enough. Let's copy it into our system. Open the Planet editor ([Shift]+[F2] or Main Menu -> Editor -> Edit planet). Make sure the planet is selected, otherwise the Editor will not open or will open for some other planet. We will talk about Editor options later. Now, press the [Export script] button:



Press the [Export] button, and a file called RS 8474-918-7-65905-410 A4.sc will appear in the export/ directory.

Now we must create a catalog script for our planetary system. Go to the addons/catalogs/planets/ folder (create it if it does not exist) and create a new file named MySystem.sc there. Open it with notepad. Also open our exported script export/RS 8474-918-7-65905-410 A4.sc, copy its content and paste into MySystem.sc. After this, you must make some edits.

First, you must choose a star for your planet to orbit. In the current version of SpaceEngine, it is impossible to create a system for a procedural star (procedural stars have a name looking like "RS 123-456-789"), so you must choose a real star from the catalog, or create a new star. So, let's choosethe star called Chara (beta Canum Venaticorum) for our example planet. This is a Sun-like star of spectral class G0V - a good choice for creating a life-bearing planet.

In the MySystem.sc file we need to come up with a good name for our planet. The star we had chosen is called Chara, so a good name for its planet is Char (hello from the Queen of Blades 🙂 ). Look at the very first line and change it from Planet "A4" to Planet "Char". Next, we must tell SpaceEngine that this planet must revolve around the star Chara. Look at the third line, and change it from ParentBody "A" to ParentBody "Chara". Now the planet will revolve around Chara, but it may have the wrong orbit, especially if you exported a moon and want to make it a planet, or vise versa. Scroll to the end of the script and find the Orbit tag. Change the parameter SemiMajorAxis to 1.0 (this means a distance from the star of 1 astronomical unit) - it's a good start for tweaking an Earth-like planet near a Sun-like star. You may also remove the Period parameter (for SE to calculate it automatically based on the mass of the star), and change the Eccentricity to some small value (so the planet's orbit will be nearly circular). Save your changes and launch SpaceEngine. Hit the [F3] key and enter your planet's name, Char. Then press the [G] key twice and you will see your planet:



It may look a bit different because you might have put in an imperfect orbital radius (semimajor axis) at first, and the planet may be too hot or too cold. You must adjust the parameters in your planet script to get it right. Remember: after editing the script, you must restart SpaceEngine to see the changes.

### USING THE PLANET EDITOR

The easiest way to tweak the planet is using the Planet editor. But it has two main restrictions for now:
1) The Editor does not save changes to the files. You must export the script and manually copy/paste the code from it.
2) The Editor is not finished yet, so it doesn't allow you to edit all parameters, and it may have some glitches.

But you can still quickly adjust the main parameters such as orbit radius (SemiMajorAxis), planet Albedo and atmosphere Greenhouse effect to achieve the desired temperature on the planet; change its radius and mass to adjust surface gravity; change atmosphere model, and change some procedural landscape forms (read the next chapter for more details).

Almost all changes require pressing the [Update] button to apply. Pressing the [Reset] button will return the settings to those the planet had before you opened the Editor. This means that if you make some changes and close the editor, you won't be able to reset them back again. Only restarting SpaceEngine will reset them (remember, Editor does not save the changes to the file). So if you want to achieve good results, or if you want to be more skilled in creating planets, read the next chapter of this tutorial.

Let's consider the parameters of our planet Char that we changed while playing with the Editor. We changed its atmospheric greenhouse effect to make it warmer, changed snow caps altitude, atmosphere model and color hue, and played with the procedural surface parameter. We could also make it ringless by deleting the Rings tag from the script and adding NoRings true (see below for details). Finally, our planet script should look like this:

And the planet itself appears in the game like this:



You may make any type of planet/moon/asteroid in the same way (find with the Star browser and export with the Planet editor). You may add code for other objects to the same script file (actually, it's recommended to have a single script file for your whole planetary system). It is also useful to let SpaceEngine generate some parameters automatically, like cloud layers for gas giants. This is also described in the next chapter.

### PLANET SCRIPT DETAILS

First, make sure you are familiar with the basics of SE scripts.

The full structure of the planet script is the following:

Code
Planet "Name"
{

<Main planet parameters>Life
{
<Life tag parameters>
}

Surface
{

<Surface tag parameters>
}

Ocean
{

<Ocean tag parameters>
}

Clouds
{

<Clouds tag parameters>
}

Atmosphere
{

<Atmosphere tag parameters>
}

Aurora
{

<Aurora tag parameters>
}

Rings
{

<Rings tag parameters, non-stars only>
}

AccretionDisk
{

<Accretion disk tag parameters, stars only>
}

CometTail
{

<CometTail tag parameters, non-stars only>
}

Corona
{

<Corona tag parameters, stars only>
}

Orbit
{

<Orbit tag parameters>
}

}

The planet must have at least the ParentBody and Mass or Radius parameters, and the Orbit tag with at least SemiMajorAxis or Period. Additionally, it and may or may not have some other parameters and tags described below (Surface, Clouds, etc.). If some parameter or tag is not specified, it may be initialized with the default value, or computed or procedurally generated by SpaceEngine. Example of a minimal planet script:

Code
Planet    "Minimus"
{
ParentBody "Vega"
Radius     7200   // or Mass 1.5
Orbit
{
SemiMajorAxis  2.5 // or Period 2.2
}

}

In this example we specified only the planet's name, its parent, its physical size or mass and its orbit size or period. SpaceEngine will compute or generate the rest of data procedurally. You may find a lot of such "poor data planets" in SpaceEngine's exoplanets catalog, because often mass or radius and period are all the data known about them to modern astronomy.

You may disable the procedural generation of some tags, except for Surface and Orbit. For example, if you are creating a planet with no life and no rings, you shouldn't type the Life and Rings tags in the code. SpaceEngine may, however, generate them procedurally. In this case you may use these parameters (in the Planet tag) to prevent the procedural generation:
NoLife true
NoOcean true
NoLava true
NoClouds true
NoAtmo true
NoAtmosphere true
NoAurora true
NoRings true
NoAccretionDisk true
NoCometTail true
NoCorona true

There is a special "No" parameter:
NoLighting true
If specified, lighting will be disabled for that object. Can be used to create a fake demo systems like a Hertzsprung–Russell star diagram, using fixed positions in space (see Orbit tag description).

Now let's look at all of the planet script tags and parameters.

### PLANET { }

This is the main planet tag, which describes the planetary body. Other possible body types are described by changing the name of the tag:

Planet - normal planet
DwarfPlanet - dwarf planet
Moon - normal moon
DwarfMoon - dwarf moon (minor irregular-shaped moons)
Asteroid - asteroid
Comet - comet
Star - star (sun)
Barycenter - barycenter of binary stars or binary planets

So, if you want to make a moon, use this code: Moon "Name" { ... }.

All the Planet, Moon etc. tags must have a name - a string value after the tag's name. If you want to give several alternate names for a body, separate them by a slash: Moon "Icarus/Archid II/ETA Cas 3.2". Greek letters are allowed, using abbreviations described in the introduction.

The Barycenter tag is a description of a fictional "body" that must be the parent body of the two stars in a binary star system or two planets in a binary planet system. It can itself orbit another body - star or other barycenter, so it's possible to make hierarchical multiple stars and binary planets. But make sure you use correct orbits for the two bodies orbiting the barycenter (see the Orbit tag description for details).

Below is the description of all parameters used in the Planet, Moon etc. tags.

ParentBody - the name of the object this body orbits (i.e. its "parent"). For example, if you are making a moon, its parent must be a planet (it is possible to make a moon orbiting a star, but this is not correct in the astronomical sense). If you are making a binary planet system or binary star system, both of its components must revolve around a barycenter, so this baycenter's name must be specified in their ParentBody parameter.

Class - the string parameter describing the surface class of a planet (affecting the procedural surface generation) or spectral class of a star. The planet classes are:
"Asteroid" - an asteroid-like body with an irregular shape.
"Selena" - a rocky planet without an atmosphere (like Mercury, Moon, Io).
"Desert" - a rocky planet with an atmosphere, but without water on its surface (like Venus and Mars).
"Terra" - a rocky planet with an atmosphere and water on its surface (like Earth).
"Oceania" or "WaterWorld" - an ocean planet.
"IceWorld" - an icy planet with or without an atmosphere (like Europa, Ganymede, Callisto).
"Titan" - an icy planet with an atmosphere and hydrocarbon oceans (like Titan).
"IceGiant" or "Neptune" - an ice giant planet (like Uranus or Neptune).
"GasGiant" or "Jovian" - a gas giant planet (like Jupiter or Saturn).
The star classes are described in the Creating a star manual.

DiscMethod - discovery method, used for real exoplanets or stars. These values are allowed:
"RadVel", "Transit", "Astrometry", "MicroLens", "Imaging", "TTV", "TDV", "OrbitLight", "ETV", "Variable", "Pulsar", "Polarimetry", "AuroraEmis", "Interfer"
DiscDate - discovery date, used for real exoplanets and stars. Format - "YYYY.MM.DD" or "YYYY". Example: DiscDate "2010.06.15" or DiscDate "2010".

Radius - surface radius in kilometers. For gas giants this is the radius of the 1 atm pressure level.
RadiusSol or RadSol - surface radius in multiples of the Sun's radius (1 Sun radius = 696,000 km).
Mass - mass in Earth masses (1 Earth mass = 5.9742·1024 kg).
MassSol - mass in Solar masses (1 Sun mass = 1.98892·1030 kg).
Msini - mass in Earth masses, multiplied by the sine of the orbit's inclination relative to the view vector. Used for real exoplanets with no inclination known. SpaceEngine attempts to calculate or generate the inclination, then computes the real mass from this. This parameter is also shown in the interface and the object's Wiki.

Oblateness - polar oblateness of the object.
OblatenessInfo - polar oblateness of the object shown in the interface. May differ from Oblateness, not used in the physics/graphics engine. If not specified, the Oblateness value is used.
InertiaMoment - inertia moment factor of the object.
Age - age of the object in billions of years (gigayears).

RotationPeriod - absolute rotation period (length of sidereal day) in hours.
RotationEpoch - rotation epoch in Julian days.
Obliquity, EqAscendNode - obliquity of the rotation axis and ascending node of the equator in degrees; jointly determines the orientation of the rotation axis.
PoleRA, PoleDec - right ascension and declination of the northern pole, alternate method of determining orientation of the rotation axis.
RotationOffset - rotation offset in degrees (i.e. orientation adjustment), used with Obliquity and EqAscendNode.
ZeroMeridian - position of the zero meridian in degrees (i.e. orientation adjustment), used with PoleRA and PoleDec.
Precession - period of the axial precession in years.
TidalLocked true - if specified, object will be tidally-locked to it's parent, i.e. will face it with one side. Script's rotational parameters will be ignored, and calculated from the orbital parameters.

AlbedoBond - the Bond albedo, affects surface temperature.
AlbedoGeom - the gemoetric albedo, affects object brightness and illumination of neighboring objects.
Albedo - specifies both Bond and geometric albedo together.
Brightness - overall rendering brightness of the object.
Color - average color of the object, used to render it as a point from a distance and to illuminate neighboring objects. If not specified, can be calculated automatically by SE when the user approaches the object.

SlopeParam - slope parameter of a comet.
AbsMagn - absolute magnitude of a star, asteroid, or comet.
AppMagn - apparent magnitude of a star.
Lum or Luminosity - luminosity of a star in solar units.
Teff or Temperature - effective ("surface") temperature of a star.

### LIFE { }

This is the life description tag.

Class - chemical class of the life:
"Organic" - Earth-like organic life based on water and carbon.
"Exotic" - life based on other principles than Earth-like life.

Type - development level of the life:
"Unicellular" - unicellular.
"Multicellular" - multicellular.

Biome - habitat of the life on the planet:
"Subglacial" - in a subsurface ocean on icy worlds like Europa.
"Marine" - marine life like on Earth.
"Terrestrial" - terrestrial life like on Earth.
"Floaters" or "Aerial" - aerial life in a gas giant atmosphere.
You may specify multiple biomes by separating them by slash: Biome "Marine/Terrestrial"

Panspermia true - means that this planet's life evolved from life forms from another planet (e.g. microbes carried from one planet to another by asteroid impact debris).

You may specify two Life tags, describing different classes of life. For example, a world like Titan could have both organic life in its subsurface ocean and exotic life on its surface and in hydrocarbons oceans.

If no Life tag is specified, the life on the planet may be generated procedurally. If you want to disable the procedural generation, use this parameter in the Planet tag:
NoLife true

### SURFACE { }, OCEAN { }, LAVA { }, CLOUDS { }

These are planet layer description tags. A layer is a spherical surface, which represents the solid surface of a planet, its ocean surface, or one or more cloud layers. Layers may or may not be displaced with a Bump map, colored by a Diffuse map and may or may not have an emission or Glow map. Each planet has at least a Surface layer, and may have an Ocean layer, and up to ten Clouds layers. The Lava layer is not implemented yet.

If one of the layer tags is not specified, that layer may be generated procedurally. If you want to disable the procedural generation of the specific layer (except the Surface), use these parameters in the Planet tag:
NoClouds true - disable all cloud layers,
NoOcean true - disable ocean,
NoLava true - disable lava (lava layer is not implemented yet).

Planet can have several cloud layers with different textures, altitudes, and moving velocities. To achieve this, simply specify the Clouds tag several times with different parameters inside them. Or you may use an empty tag: Clouds { } to let SpaceEngine generate all parameters procedurally. A planet can also have several ocean layers, but this is useless now.

Below there are descriptions of all parameters allowed inside these tags. First we will describe the parameters common to all layers, then the parameters allowed only in a specific layer tag.

PARAMETERS COMMON FOR ALL THE SURFACE, OCEAN, AND CLOUDS TAGS
If you are making a planet with textures stored on disk, use the DiffMap, BumpMap, and GlowMap parameters to describe the textures (read this manual for details: Creating custom planet textures).

DiffMap, BumpMap, GlowMap - path of the folder with cubemap texture tiles for the Diffuse, Bump, and Glow maps respectively. If not specified, a procedural map may be generated.
DiffTileSize, BumpTileSize, GlowTileSize - resolution of the tile images for the corresponding maps.
DiffTileBorder, BumpTileBorder, GlowTileBorder - width of the border on the tile images for the corresponding maps.

BumpHeight - height scale of the Bump map in km, i.e. height difference between the lowest and highest point on the layer.
BumpOffset - negative offset of the landscape in km. For example, if you want to make a landscape from -8 km to +12 km, type BumpHeight 20 and BumpOffset 8.

DiffMapAlpha - how to use the alpha channel of the Diff texture:
"Water" - water specular (solar specular spot on water surfaces), used as a river/lakes/seas mask on Earth
"Ice" - ice specular (solar specular spot follows all curved surfaces of the body), used as an ice mask on a cold planets,
"Transp" - surface transparency, used for clouds only,
"None" - ignore the alpha channel.

GlowMode - how to use the Glow texture:
"Alpha" - the mode is set by the alpha channel of the glow texture (0.0-0.33 = night, 0.34-0.66 = permanent, 0.67-1.0 = thermal),
"Night" - night side city lights (not visible in daytime),
"Permanent" - permanent lights (do not react to external lighting),
"Thermal" - thermal lights, react to local temperature, and have a complex format (RGB channels of the texture represents a single 24-bit temperature value).

GlowColor - scale (multiply) the RGB color of the Glow texture by this value.
GlowBright - overall brightness of the Glow texture.

ModulateColor - scale (multiply) the RGB and Alpha colors of the Diff texture by this value.

SpecBrightIce - brightness of the solar glare spot on the ice surface.
SpecularBright - brightness of the solar glare spot on the both water and ice surfaces.
SpecularPower or SpecPower - size of the solar glare spot (default value is 55) - the lower the value, the larger the spot.

Hapke or Lommel - Lambert lighting model to Hapke lighting model ratio. Use Hapke 0.0 for pure Lambert model (good for gas giants) or Hapke 1.0 for pure Hapke model (good for dusty bodies, like airless or desert planets - simulates the opposition glare effect). Use intermediate values for mixed lighting models (linear interpolation).
SpotBright - brightness of the opposition glare spot.
SpotWidth - size of the opposition glare spot.

DayAmbient - fake ambient lighting during daytime. Use for bodies without atmospheres and for cloud layers.

Exposure - the same as Brightness in the Planet tag - overall rendering brightness of the object. Saved for backward compatibility.

PARAMETERS ALLOWED ONLY IN THE SURFACE TAG
The following parameters control the procedural surface textures.

SurfStyle or Style - style (color scheme) of the surface. Corresponds to the StyleRange in the palette file.
OceanStyle - style (color scheme) of the ocean. Corresponds to the StyleRange in the palette file.
Randomize - a randomization vector. If you make two identical planets (with all parameters identical), type different randomization values to make them look different.

Alpha value, if specified, modulates the brightness of the ice specular (on cold planets), or cloud layer temperature (for hot gas giants and brown dwarfs).

colorLayer0, colorLayer1, colorLayer2, colorLayer3, colorLayer4, colorLayer5, colorLayer6, colorLayer7 - the same as previous, can be used for gas giants and brown dwarfs (with less confusion).

colorLowPlants and colorUpPlants - modification of colorLowland and colorUpland parameters for planets with life, sets the vegetation color.

PARAMETERS ALLOWED ONLY IN THE OCEAN TAG
Height - height of the water surface above the lowest point of the planet's surface in kilometers (i.e. from the Radius in the Planet tag minus BumpOffset in the Surface tag). Make it lower than the highest mountains (less than BumpHeight) to obtain the seas and continents, and above them to get a planet completely covered by water.

PARAMETERS ALLOWED ONLY IN THE CLOUDS TAG
Height - the height of the clouds above the lowest point of the planet's surface in kilometers (i.e. from the Radius in the Planet tag minus BumpOffset in the Surface tag). Make it higher than the highest mountains (more than BumpHeight), if you want clouds to not overlap with mountains.
Velocity - velocity of the clouds at the equator relative to the planet's surface, in kilometers per second.
Coverage - clouds coverage (0...1). Note that this is very approximate coverage amount.
ModulateColor - scale (multiply) the RGB and Alpha colors of the clouds Diff texture by this value. Use alpha component to specify overall clouds layer opacity.

The next parameters control the procedural cloud textures.

cycloneMagn, cycloneFreq, cycloneDensity, cycloneOctaves - cyclones magnitude, frequency, density, and number of octaves (used for gas giants and terrestrial planets).

TidalLocked true - if specified, the cloud layer will form a giant cyclone on one side of a planet. Used for a planet tidally locked to its sun.

Note about multiple clouds layers. You can type the Clouds tag several times with empty curly braces:
Clouds { }
Clouds { }
Clouds { }
This will generate three cloud layers with automatic procedural parameters. However, you can type Height, Velocity and other physical parameters for each Clouds tag individually. But the procedural texture parameters will always be the same in each cloud layer, so you can type them in any Clouds tag or even in the Surface tag (look above).

### ATMOSPHERE { }

This is the atmosphere tag. SpaceEngine uses several precomputed atmosphere models, stored in the data/models/atmospheres/Atmospheres.pak file, in a special binary format with the extension .atm. They are described in the script file atmospheres.cfg, stored in the same pak file. To add your own model, you may create a new file addons/models/atmospheres/MyModels.cfg (file name doesn't matter), and enter the atmosphere model scripts there. Note that not all computers can correctly generate the .atm files due to unsupported geometry shaders or some other issues. Also, the newly created atmosphere model may be used only with your planets, they will not appear on any procedural planets in the SE Universe. So it is recommended to just use standard SE models. You may adjust their appearance with wide limits using parameters Bright, Hue, and Saturation (see below).
List of the standard atmosphere models:
Earth.atm - Earth atmosphere model, normal density, blue sky and red sunset.
Mars.atm - Mars atmosphere model, normal density, red sky and blue sunset.
Venus.atm - Venus atmosphere model, thick, yellow sky and blue sunset, big density.
Jupiter.atm - Jupiter atmosphere model, normal density, white sky and yellow sunset.
Neptune.atm - Neptune atmosphere model, normal density, deep blue sky and pink sunset.
Titan.atm - Titan atmosphere model, normal density, violet-green-orange sky and red sunset.
Pluto.atm - Pluto atmosphere model, thin, nearly black sky and pale blue sunset.
Chlorine.atm - Custom atmosphere model, thick, green sky and green sunset.
Thick.atm - Custom atmosphere model, thick, white sky and orange sunset.
Sun.atm - Custom atmosphere model, thin, white sky and white sunset (resulting color is matched to star's light color).

Model - the name of the atmosphere model listed above, or your own model if you have created one (without a file extension, i.e. "Earth", "Venus", etc).
Height - height of the top boundary of the atmosphere in km. Typical value 50-100 km for terrestrial planets, 500-2000 km for gas giants.
Pressure - pressure at zero height in [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit)]atmospheres[/url].
Density - density of the air at zero height in kg/m3.
MolarMass - average molar mass of air gases in g/mol.
Adiabat - adiabatic index.
Greenhouse - temperature of the greenhouse effect in Kelvins.
Bright - rendering brightness. Default value is 10.
Opacity - rendering opacity. To avoid visual artifacts, use the default value of 1.
SkyLight - brightness of the illumination of the planet's surface by the sky during the day. Default value is 3.3333.
Hue - change of the color hue. Default value is 0.
Saturation - change of the color saturation. Default value is 1.

Composition - the tag describing the chemical composition of the atmosphere. The tag must contain several numerical parameters named after gases; values are the amount of these gases in percent. Example of the Composition tag for Earth:

Code
Composition
{
N2  77.7729
O2  20.8625
Ar  0.9303
H2O 0.4000
CO2 0.0398
}


Supported gases are: H2, He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, O2, N2, CO, CO2, SO, SO2, Cl2, NaCl, H2S, H2O, NH3, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H8. SpaceEngine can compute Density, MolarMass, Adiabat and Greenhouse based on atmosphere composition.

All values except Composition can be changed in real time with the Planet editor.

If the Atmosphere tag is not specified, the atmosphere may be generated procedurally. If you want to disable the procedural generation, use this parameter in the Planet tag:
NoAtmosphere true

### AURORA { }

This is the aurora tag. For physical realism, do not create aurora on airless bodies. Aurora is always created at the top of the atmosphere, this means that its bottom height is equal to the height of the atmosphere.

Height - the vertical span of the aurora in km.
TopColor - aurora top color (RGB).
BottomColor - aurora bottom color (RGB).

The next set of parameters describes the north and south auroral rings, respectively.

NorthLat, SouthLat - latitude of the center of the auroral ring in degrees.
NorthLon, SouthLon - longitude of the center of the auroral ring in degrees.
NorthRadius, SouthRadius - radius of the auroral ring in km.
NorthWidth, SouthWidth - width of the auroral ring in km.
NorthRings, SouthRings - number of "stripes" or "subrings".
NorthBright, SouthBright - brightness of the auroral ring.
NorthParticles, SouthParticles - number of particles (sprites) in the auroral ring. The default vale of 50000 is used if not specified.

If the Aurora tag is not specified, the aurora may be generated procedurally. If you want to disable the procedural generation, use this parameter in the Planet tag:
NoAurora true

### RINGS { }

This is the planetary rings system tag. Used for planets, moons, and asteroids.

Texture - the path to the rings texture. It must be in RGBA format and have dimensions of x*2 pixels, where x is the length of texture (512, 1024, etc). The first row of pixels is a front-light radial color pattern (with opacity in the alpha channel), and the second row is a back-light radial color pattern (with opacity in alpha channel). Look at Saturn's rings in SpaceEngine: it has a different appearance when it is back-lit, i.e. when the Sun is behind Saturn. If the Texture parameter is not specified, a procedural texture will be generated.

InnerRadius - radius of the inner edge of the rings in km.
OuterRadius - radius of the outer edge of the rings in km.
FrontBright - brightness of rings when front-lit.
BackBright - brightness of rings when back-lit.
Density - global opacity multiplier.
Brightness or Exposure - global brightness multiplier.

RotationPeriod - rings rotation period in hours.
RotationOffset - rotation offset in degrees (i.e. orientation adjusting). Does not affect anything because ring textures in the current version (0.9.8.0) have no longitudinal features.

If the Rings tag is not specified, the rings may be generated procedurally. If you want to disable the procedural generation, use this parameter in the Planet tag:
NoRings true

### ACCRETIONDISK { }

This is the accretion disk tag. Used to create an accretion disk around a black hole, neutron star, or white dwarf.

InnerRadius - radius of the inner edge of the disk in AU. If not specified, a procedural value is generated.
OuterRadius or Radius - radius of the outer edge of the disk in AU.
AccretionRate - accretion rate in solar masses per year. Used to calculate other parameters if they are not specified.
Temperature - temperature of the hottest part of the disk in Kelvin.
Luminosity - luminosity of the disk in Solar luminosities.
TwistMagn - strength of the twist effect on the texture.
Density - density or opacity value.
Brightness or Exposure - global brightness multiplier.

If the AccretionDisk tag is not specified, the accretion disk may be generated procedurally for black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs. If you want to disable the procedural generation, use this parameter in the Planet tag:
NoAccretionDisk true

### CORONA { }

This is the star corona tag. Used only for normal stars (i.e. not allowed for black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs). The corona effect is procedural.

Period - animation period in years; the lower the value, the faster animation is.
Radius - radius of the corona in km.
Brightness - brightness of the corona.
RayDensity - density of the ray-like features.
RayCurv - curvature of the ray-like features.

If the Corona tag is not specified, the star corona will be generated procedurally. If you want to disable the procedural generation, use this parameter in the Planet tag:
NoCorona true

### ORBIT { }

This is the orbit tag. The current version (0.9.8.0) uses only Kepler's equation to compute the orbital motions of the bodies. This tag uses Kepler orbital elements to describe the orbit of the object.

Epoch - epoch of the periapsis passage in Julian days.
Period - orbital period T in years (used for circular and elliptical orbits). 1 year = 365.24218985 days.
MeanMotion - mean motion n in degrees per day (used for parabolic and hyperbolic orbits).
GravParam - gravity parameter ? (used for parabolic and hyperbolic orbits).
SemiMajorAxis - semimajor axis a in AU (used for elliptic and hyperbolic orbits). Negative for hyperbolic orbits.
PericenterDist - periapsis distance q in AU (used for parabolic and hyperbolic orbits).
Eccentricity - eccentricity e.
Inclination - inclination i in degrees.
AscendingNode - longitude of the ascending node ? in degrees.
ArgOfPericen or ArgOfPericenter - argument of periapsis ? in degrees.
LongOfPericen or LongOfPericenter - longitude of periapsis (? + ?) in degrees.
AscNodePreces - period of precession of the longitude of the ascending node in years.
ArgOfPeriPreces - period of precession of the argument of periapsis in years.
MeanAnomaly - mean anomaly at epoch M0 in degrees.
MeanLongitude - mean longitude at epoch L0 (M0 + ? + ?) in degrees.

RefPlane or Type - specifies the reference plane for the Keplerian orbit, or used to describe a special type of object placement. If not specified, default value is assigned, based on the object type. Possible values are:
"Equator" or "Laplace" - reference plane is the parent object's equatorial plane. Default for moons.
"Ecliptic" - reference plane is the ecliptic plane (our Solar system's one!). Default for asteroids and comets.
"Extrasolar" - reference plane is the image plane (i.e. the plane perpendicular to the visual ray while looking from the Earth). Default for planets, stars, and barycenters.
"Static" - the object will be fixed relative to the parent object, and will follow it while it moves. Parameters PosXYZ and PosPolar is used to specify the relative position.
"Fixed" - the object will be fixed relative to the parent object, and will follow it and rotate with it. Parameters PosXYZ and PosPolar is used to specify the relative position.

The "Static" and "Fixed" types are used to make unrealistic systems with objects fixed in relation to each other. They use these parameters to specify the position relative to the parent object:

PosXYZ - a position vector in Cartesian coordinates, in km. Example: PosXYZ (5000 1000 2000).
PosPolar - a position in spherical coordinates, in the form of (longitude in degrees, latitude in degrees, distance in kilometers). Example: PosPolar (45 30 3000).

There are also simplified forms of the static and fixed positions. These parameters must be used in the Planet tag instead of Orbit tag:
StaticPosXYZ - equal to the Orbit { } tag with Type "Static" and PosXYZ.
StaticPosPolar - equal to the Orbit { } tag with Type "Static" and PosPolar.
FixedPosXYZ - equal to the Orbit { } tag with Type "Fixed" and PosXYZ.
FixedPosPolar - equal to the Orbit { } tag with Type "Fixed" and PosPolar.

If the Orbit { } tag is not specified, it is equal to a static position with coordinates (0, 0, 0), i.e. in the center of the parent body. This is used to describe a solitary star with additional parameters, placed in the center of the system. See Creating a star for details.

Different default reference planes are chosen for different types of objects to make the massive catalogs more compact. Ecliptic is used in our Solar System for planets, asteroids and comets. Planets in the Solar System catalog have RefPlane "Ecliptic" specified directly, because the default for planets is "Extrasolar". So the asteroids and comets catalog do not use RefPlane, which makes them more compact. The same is true of the exoplanet catalog and the catalog of binary and multiple stars: the default RefPlane for them is "Extrasolar". If you are making a custom planetary system, it's better to specify RefPlane directly for its planets and asteroids. Specify RefPlane "Equator" to align their orbits with the star's rotational axis. You need not specify RefPlane for moons, because the default value "Equator" is good for them.

Some orbital parameters, if not specified, can be calculated or generated by SE from other parameters. For example, Period can be calculated from SemiMajorAxis or PericenterDist and the mass of the parent object. If Inclination and AscendingNode are unknown for some planets in the planetary system, they can be procedurally generated based on other planets with known Inclination and AscendingNode in the same system.

To make a binary star system or a binary planet system, make sure that the following parameters are the same for both bodies in the system: Eccentricity, Inclination, AscendingNode, MeanAnomaly. The ArgOfPericenter parameter of the first body must differ by 180 degrees from the same parameter of the second body. It's also necessary to calculate the SemiMajorAxis parameter for each body based on their masses using these simple formulae:

Body 1: a1 = R * M2 / (M1 + M2)
Body 2: a2 = R * M1 / (M1 + M2)

where R is the distance between the bodies, i.e. sum of their semimajor axes a1 + a2;
M1 and M2 are masses of bodies.

A triple star system is usually hierarchical: two stars orbiting their common barycenter, and this barycenter and the third star orbiting the main system barycenter. The same hierarchical principle can be applied to more complex systems. To calculate the correct semimajor axes for each pair, you must calculate the mass of each barycenter, using the sum of the masses of all the stars/star systems orbiting it, and use that in the formula listed above.

If you provided the masses of the object and its parent object, SpaceEngine can compute the orbital period automatically. For binary objects (binary stars and planets), it might be necessary to compute the orbital period manually. Use this formula:

P = sqrt(R3 / (M1 + M2))

Here sqrt is the square root function;
R is the distance between the bodies, i.e. the sum of their semimajor axes a1 + a2, in astronomical units;
M1 and M2 are the masses of the bodies in Solar masses;
then period P will be in years.
